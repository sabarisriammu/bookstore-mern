## 🐛 **BUG FIX #1: Admin Dashboard Stats Not Updating**

### **Problem:**
The admin dashboard was showing incorrect revenue statistics because of a case-sensitivity mismatch in the database query.

### **Root Cause:**
In `backend/controllers/adminController.js`, the revenue calculation was querying for orders with status `'delivered'` (lowercase), but the Order model enum defines the status as `'Delivered'` (capitalized).

### **Solution:**
✅ **Fixed line 17** in `backend/controllers/adminController.js`:
- Changed: `{ $match: { status: 'delivered' } }`
- To: `{ $match: { status: 'Delivered' } }`

### **Impact:**
- ✅ Total Revenue now calculates correctly
- ✅ Admin dashboard stats update properly
- ✅ Auto-refresh mechanism (already implemented) now shows accurate data

## ✨ **FEATURE #2: Payment Method Selection**

### **What Was Added:**
A complete payment method selection system with support for multiple payment options.

### **Changes Made:**

#### **1. Backend - Order Model** (`backend/models/Order.js`)
✅ Updated `paymentMethod` enum to include all common payment methods:
- Cash on Delivery
- Credit Card
- Debit Card
- PayPal
- UPI
- Net Banking
- Stripe

#### **2. Frontend - Checkout Page** (`frontend/src/pages/Checkout.js`)
✅ Added payment method selection with 6 options

- **UPI**: Shows UPI ID input field
- **Net Banking**: Shows bank selection dropdown
- **PayPal**: Shows informational message about redirect
- **Cash on Delivery**: Shows confirmation message

✅ Smart validation:
- Only validates required fields for the selected payment method
- Different validation rules for different payment types

#### **3. Frontend - Order Details Page** (`frontend/src/pages/OrderDetails.js`)
✅ Displays the selected payment method dynamically
✅ Shows payment status with color coding:
- Green: Paid
- Red: Failed
- Purple: Refunded
- Yellow: Pending

#### **4. Frontend - Admin Orders Page** (`frontend/src/pages/AdminOrders.js`)
✅ Added "Payment" column to orders table
