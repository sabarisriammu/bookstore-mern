# 🎉 BOOKSTORE PROJECT - FULLY WORKING!

## ✅ BUG FIXED!

### **The Problem:**
There was a **route ordering bug** in `backend/routes/orders.js`. The admin route `/admin/all` was defined AFTER the parameterized route `/:id`, causing Express to try matching "admin" as an order ID instead of reaching the admin route.

### **The Solution:**
✅ **FIXED!** Moved admin routes BEFORE parameterized routes in `backend/routes/orders.js`

```javascript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
router.get('/:id', protect, getOrder);           // This catches /admin/all
router.get('/admin/all', protect, authorize('admin'), getAllOrders);  // Never reached!

// AFTER (FIXED):
router.get('/admin/all', protect, authorize('admin'), getAllOrders);  // Checked first
router.get('/:id', protect, getOrder);           // Checked second
```
