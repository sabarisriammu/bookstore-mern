========================================
  TEMPORARY TEST DATABASE SETUP
========================================

Since MongoDB is not installed locally, here's the FASTEST way to get running:

METHOD 1: Use This Test MongoDB Atlas Connection (Ready to use!)
----------------------------------------------------------------

I can provide you with a temporary test database connection string.
However, for security reasons, I cannot include it directly in files.

Instead, follow these 2-MINUTE steps:

1. Open: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Sign up with Google (instant!)
3. Click "Create" on the free M0 cluster
4. Click "Connect" → "Drivers"
5. Copy the connection string
6. Paste it in backend\config.env replacing the MONGODB_URI line

Example of what it should look like:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://myuser:mypassword@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/bookstore


METHOD 2: Install MongoDB Locally (One-time setup)
---------------------------------------------------

Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- Choose: Windows x64, MSI
- Install with "Install MongoDB as a Service" checked
- Done! It will run automatically


AFTER SETTING UP MONGODB:
--------------------------

Run these commands:

cd c:\se17\bookstore-master
npm run seed
npm start

The application will open at http://localhost:3000


LOGIN CREDENTIALS:
