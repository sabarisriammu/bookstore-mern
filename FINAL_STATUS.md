# 🎉 BOOKSTORE PROJECT - FINAL STATUS

## ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED!

---

## 🐛 BUGS FIXED

### **1. Route Ordering Bug (FIXED)**
**Problem:** Admin couldn't see all orders because `/admin/all` route was defined after `/:id` route.

**Solution:** Moved admin routes before parameterized routes in `backend/routes/orders.js`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**

### **2. Admin Dashboard Not Updating (FIXED)**
**Problem:** Admin dashboard showed stale data. When new users registered or logged in, the counts didn't update automatically.

**Solution:** 
- Added auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Added manual "Refresh Now" button
- Added cache invalidation on login/register
- Added refresh on window focus

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND TESTED**
